The incrementTimeElapsedInSeconds function is written to handle the logic of incrementing the elapsed time for the timer. It checks if the timer has completed (i.e., whether the elapsed time equals the timer limit in seconds) and updates the state accordingly.

Reasons for memorizing the function using useCallback:

Performance Optimization: By using useCallback, the function is memoized, meaning it will only be recreated if its dependencies change. This is particularly useful in functional components where functions are recreated on every render. Memoization helps to avoid unnecessary re-renders of components that depend on this function.

Preventing Unnecessary Effects: The incrementTimeElapsedInSeconds function is used inside the useEffect hook that sets up the timer. If the function were not memoized, it would be considered a new function on every render, causing the effect to run again and again, which could lead to multiple intervals being set up and potential performance issues.

Dependency Management: The function relies on timeElapsedInSeconds and timerLimitInMinutes. By memoizing it, we ensure that it only updates when one of these dependencies changes, thus maintaining the correct logic without causing unnecessary updates.

In summary, incrementTimeElapsedInSeconds is necessary for tracking the timer's elapsed time, and memoizing it with useCallback helps optimize performance and manage dependencies effectively within the component.
