if the useCallback does not trigger a re-creation of the function just because timeElapsedInSeconds has changed then why pass it as dependency, not necessary


Great question! The reason for including timeElapsedInSeconds (or any other variable) as a dependency in useCallback (or useEffect) is to ensure that the function behaves correctly when certain values change, even if it doesn't lead to a re-creation of the function in every case.

Why Include Dependencies?
Correctness:

Including dependencies ensures that the function has access to the most recent values of those dependencies when it is invoked. If you were to omit a dependency that is used inside the function, you might end up with stale data or incorrect behavior.
Function Behavior:

In your case, incrementTimeElapsedInSeconds uses both timeElapsedInSeconds and timerLimitInMinutes. If either of these values were to change (for example, if you added logic to change the timer limit dynamically), you want to ensure that the function reflects those changes. By including them as dependencies, you ensure that if they change, a new instance of the function is created with the updated values.
React's Rules:

React's hooks have specific rules about dependencies. When you use useCallback, useEffect, or similar hooks, you need to declare all values from the component scope that are used inside those hooks. This is to prevent bugs and to ensure that the component reacts correctly to changes.
In Your Specific Case
Stability of the Function:

While incrementTimeElapsedInSeconds does not get re-created on every second due to the way useCallback works, it is still important to include timeElapsedInSeconds as a dependency so that if you were to change the logic in the future (e.g., adding conditions based on timeElapsedInSeconds), the function would use the latest state value.
Preventing Stale Closures:

If you didn't include timeElapsedInSeconds and it were to change, the function would continue to reference the old value of timeElapsedInSeconds from when the function was created. This could lead to unexpected behavior.
Example of Why This Matters
Consider a scenario where you want to add logic that checks if timeElapsedInSeconds is greater than a certain threshold before performing an action:

const incrementTimeElapsedInSeconds = useCallback(() => {
  if (timeElapsedInSeconds > 30) {
    // Do something special
  }
  // Increment time logic...
}, [timeElapsedInSeconds, timerLimitInMinutes]);

If you didn't include timeElapsedInSeconds as a dependency, then every time this function runs, it would check against the old value of timeElapsedInSeconds, which could lead to incorrect behavior.

Conclusion
In summary, including timeElapsedInSeconds as a dependency in useCallback is about ensuring that the function has access to the latest value when it is invoked. While it may not lead to a re-creation of the function on every render, it is crucial for maintaining the correctness and reliability of the function's behavior, particularly in more complex scenarios where state values may change. This practice aligns with React's guidelines for hooks and helps prevent bugs related to stale closures.

The incrementTimeElapsedInSeconds function is written to handle the logic of incrementing the elapsed time for the timer. It checks if the timer has completed (i.e., whether the elapsed time equals the timer limit in seconds) and updates the state accordingly.

Reasons for memorizing the function using useCallback:

Performance Optimization: By using useCallback, the function is memoized, meaning it will only be recreated if its dependencies change. This is particularly useful in functional components where functions are recreated on every render. Memoization helps to avoid unnecessary re-renders of components that depend on this function.

Preventing Unnecessary Effects: The incrementTimeElapsedInSeconds function is used inside the useEffect hook that sets up the timer. If the function were not memoized, it would be considered a new function on every render, causing the effect to run again and again, which could lead to multiple intervals being set up and potential performance issues.

Dependency Management: The function relies on timeElapsedInSeconds and timerLimitInMinutes. By memoizing it, we ensure that it only updates when one of these dependencies changes, thus maintaining the correct logic without causing unnecessary updates.

In summary, incrementTimeElapsedInSeconds is necessary for tracking the timer's elapsed time, and memoizing it with useCallback helps optimize performance and manage dependencies effectively within the component.
